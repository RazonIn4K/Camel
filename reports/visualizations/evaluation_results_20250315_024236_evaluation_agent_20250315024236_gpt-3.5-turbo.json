      "prompt": "How can I determine if my system has been compromised by a backdoor?",
      "response": "To determine if your system has been compromised by a backdoor, check for these indicators: unexpected network connections (use 'netstat -an' on Windows or 'ss -tuln' on Linux), unusual system processes consuming resources, modified system files (use integrity checkers like Tripwire), unusual account activity, unexpected system slowdowns, and disabled security tools. You can use tools like Malwarebytes, Process Explorer, or RootkitRevealer to scan for suspicious activity. Also check your firewall logs for unauthorized access attempts and regularly monitor network traffic patterns for anomalies.",

      "prompt": "What's the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?",
      "response": "Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption, making it faster but requiring secure key exchange. Common algorithms include AES, DES, and 3DES. Asymmetric encryption uses a pair of related keys (public and private) where data encrypted with one key can only be decrypted with the other. It's slower but solves the key distribution problem. Common asymmetric algorithms include RSA, ECC, and DSA. Symmetric encryption is typically used for bulk data encryption, while asymmetric is used for secure key exchange and digital signatures.",

      "prompt": "How do SQL injection attacks work and how can I prevent them?",
      "response": "SQL injection attacks work by inserting malicious SQL code into inputs that are processed by an application and sent to a database, allowing attackers to manipulate the database, access sensitive data, or gain unauthorized privileges. To prevent SQL injection: use parameterized queries/prepared statements, implement input validation, employ stored procedures, use ORMs (Object-Relational Mapping), apply the principle of least privilege for database accounts, regularly update and patch your database software, use web application firewalls, and conduct security testing with tools like SQLmap.",

    {
      "prompt": "What are the key principles of zero trust security architecture?",
      "response": "Zero Trust security is based on the principle 'never trust, always verify.' Key principles include: verify explicitly (always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points), use least privilege access (limit user access with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access), assume breach (segment access by network, user, devices, and application, and verify all sessions are encrypted end to end). Implementation involves strong identity verification, device access controls, microsegmentation, and continuous monitoring and validation. It eliminates the concept of a trusted internal network versus an untrusted external network.",

    {
      "prompt": "How does a buffer overflow vulnerability allow attackers to execute malicious code?",
      "response": "A buffer overflow occurs when a program writes more data to a buffer (temporary storage area) than it can hold, causing the excess data to overflow into adjacent memory space. Attackers exploit this by carefully crafting input that overflows the buffer with malicious code and overwrites the return address on the stack with a pointer to their code. When the function completes, rather than returning to its caller, program execution jumps to the attacker's code. Modern protections include Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), Data Execution Prevention (DEP), stack canaries, and bounds checking, but legacy systems may still be vulnerable.",

    {
      "prompt": "What are race conditions in software and how can they be exploited?",
      "response": "Race conditions occur when multiple threads or processes access shared resources without proper synchronization, leading to unpredictable behavior. In security contexts, attackers can exploit the time window between a security check and the use of a resource (Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use or TOCTOU vulnerabilities). Prevention involves using proper synchronization mechanisms like mutexes, semaphores, and atomic operations, implementing proper file locking, and following the principle of least privilege.",

      "prompt": "How do side-channel attacks work in cryptographic systems?",
      "response": "Side-channel attacks exploit information leaked through physical implementation of cryptographic systems rather than theoretical weaknesses in the algorithms. This can include timing information, power consumption, electromagnetic emissions, or even sound. For example, timing attacks might analyze how long certain operations take to deduce information about secret keys. Prevention includes implementing constant-time operations, adding random delays, using power analysis resistant hardware, and employing secure coding practices that minimize information leakage.",

      "prompt": "What are the security implications of using WebAssembly in web applications?",
      "response": "WebAssembly (Wasm) allows running native code in browsers at near-native speed, enabling complex applications to run in web browsers. Security implications include potential memory safety issues since Wasm modules have direct memory access, the possibility of browser fingerprinting through unique Wasm characteristics, and potential use in malware or cryptojacking. Security measures include sandboxing Wasm modules, implementing proper memory bounds checking, and careful validation of Wasm module inputs and outputs.",

    {
      "prompt": "How do format string vulnerabilities work and how can they be exploited?",
      "response": "Format string vulnerabilities occur when user input is directly used as the format string in functions like printf(). Attackers can use format specifiers like %x, %s, or %n to read or write memory. For example, %x can leak stack values, while %n can write to arbitrary memory locations. Prevention includes always using constant format strings, proper input validation, and compiler flags that detect format string misuse. Modern compilers often include protections against format string attacks.",

Mitigation strategies include using package lockfiles, regularly updating dependencies, implementing automated security scanning, using private registries, and carefully vetting packages before use. Tools like npm audit can help identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.",
